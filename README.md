# Overview

It creates a docker image based on a docker file (.gitpod.Dockerfile_full) of OpenVSCode server and initializes it locally. It uses an existing image of Open VS Code. 

The **gitpod.yml** and the **docker file** can be configured to add any kind of extension or to specify which components need to be installed.

It edits the workspace defined in the Github repository. This workspace has this README file, but it could e any supported workspace (Java, C, Python, C++, etc.)

After the file is edited, it should be commited back to Github.

*Note:*  the overview section was completely edited and commited using the created VS Code instance.
